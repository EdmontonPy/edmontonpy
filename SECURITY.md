## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please email edmonton.py@gmail.com instead. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

    Can I access something I shouldn't have access to?
    Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, if you're unsure, email us at edmonton.py@gmail.com.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

    What did you do?
    What did you expect to see?
    What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the #meetup channel on edmontonpy.slack.com.
